## 理解问题与方法

任务体验可以揭示评分规则没有直接表达的困难，例如信息入口不明显或操作步骤很长。但个别操作者的路径只是一个样本，不能直接等同于人类平均水平。本目录既有记录由模型操作，应按模型轨迹理解。

### 这是一组模型操作轨迹，不是真人能力基线

当前实验编号为 7-2，原始英文标题沿用了旧编号 6.2。执行者是 Codex；目录名称中的 human benchmark 指按操作者路径完成任务，并不表示仓库作者或用户亲自完成了这些案例。

六类基准各预先选定简单、中等、困难各一题，共 18 题。选择清单在执行和查看标准答案前固定，答案或产物冻结后只调用一次官方评估器，保留首次终止结果；失败后不换题、不修补再提交。已有总结果为 13/18（72.2%），五个首次失败也完整保留。

<a id="learning-1"></a>

## 准备环境与输入

本节适合先结合已有记录阅读。先弄清记录对应的任务、版本与运行条件，再决定是否准备完整环境复现；已有输出是学习材料，也有其适用范围。

### 先理解难度定义和兼容条件

GAIA 使用上游 Level 1/2/3，AndroidWorld 与 Terminal-Bench 使用上游难度标签，SWE-bench 使用人工耗时桶，τ²-bench 使用两、三、九个组合故障。OSWorld 没有难度字段，这里预先用单应用设置、单应用结构变换和跨应用产物变换作为代理。因此，不同基准的“困难”并不是同一种量尺。

AndroidWorld 在当前服务器使用上游 UIAUTOMATOR 获取观察，保留初始化和官方评分器；τ²-bench 因托管用户模型凭据不可用，改用 CPU 上的 Qwen2.5-3B 用户模拟器；OSWorld 使用 Docker/KVM 与可见 PyAutoGUI 操作；SWE-bench 最终冻结补丁由官方容器评分。本地安装失败属于环境记录，不能直接当作模型任务得分。

<a id="learning-2"></a>

## 按照步骤完成实验

先从选择清单中挑一道简单任务，阅读目标后独立想出操作路线，再与已有轨迹比较。随后看一道失败任务，判断失败来自理解、工具操作还是环境。重跑外部任务的环境要求见下文的详细步骤。

### 按“任务—轨迹—判定”阅读十八个案例

先从 `selection_manifest.json` 和 `results.json` 确认题目，再打开对应 `runs/` 记录。英文部分按六类基准保留了每一道题的任务 ID、固定提交、完整操作过程和首次评分，阅读时可以先预测结果，再核对官方判定。

- GAIA：倒序指令与校验码推断通过；原子距离题计算得到 1.4564234018325806 Å，按题意舍入到 1.46 Å，却与精确评分器的 1.456 不一致。这展示了任务文字与答案规范化的边界。
- AndroidWorld：创建联系人和拍摄视频通过；浏览器乘法题算出 840，但页面没有达到 Success! 状态。正确算术与完成界面操作是两项条件。
- SWE-bench：Django 的 memoryview 字节处理和 Astropy 多必需列错误信息通过；Sphinx 补丁处理了字面量语法，却遗漏官方要求的 ABI 表达式身份。这说明局部测试不覆盖全部语义契约。
- τ²-bench：两故障与三故障任务通过；九故障任务最终修好了环境，但本地用户模拟器多次角色倒置，导致达到 100 步上限，没有被识别为正常终止。最终状态正确仍可能不满足回合协议。
- Terminal-Bench：执行权限与单电子表格填充通过；DNA 组装产物正确，但一对引物的完整退火段温差违反约束。主要目标正确并不免除次要约束。
- OSWorld：自动恢复设置、查表填充和提取幻灯片备注三题通过；每个产物都在评分前冻结，并核对持久化状态、顺序、文件名或格式要求。

## 分析结果与形成判断

保留第一次失败有助于理解真实难点。不要把修复后的结果替换原始记录，也不要将模型执行记录表述成人类被试实验。

### 从失败类型理解总分

GAIA、AndroidWorld、SWE-bench、τ²-bench 和 Terminal-Bench 都为 2/3，OSWorld 为 3/3；简单、中等、困难三档合计分别为 6/6、5/6、2/6。样本很小且刻意分层，这些数值用于学习评估方法，不构成通用排行榜或真人基线。

五个失败分别暴露答案规范化、最终 UI 状态、隐藏语义契约、附加约束和回合终止协议。完整案例中保留了首次操作与证据不足之处，例如浏览器提交失败无法区分焦点、点击未注册或其他短暂状态问题。应保留这些不确定性，避免用“答案看起来对”替代官方终止结果。

### 检查自己的解释

如果要正式建立人类基线，除了任务选择，还需要怎样记录参与者背景、时间限制和尝试次数？

# Experiment 6.2: Codex as the human benchmark operator

This document records one easy, one medium, and one hard case from each of the six benchmark families named by Experiment 6.2. Codex personally operated every case. These are **Codex's trajectories**, not work performed by the repository owner or user.

The final result is **13/18 passed (72.2%)**. All 18 selected cases reached one terminal official result; five first-attempt failures are retained without repair or score-seeking reruns.

## Methodology

Task selection was locked before solving and before inspecting gold answers or reference patches. The preregistration is [`selection_manifest.json`](selection_manifest.json), committed separately before execution. Its SHA-256 is `0fa3f6f890e69c0e51db6ea50d46186af999c5ad0a24284055bbebd667fa15b7`.

The rules for every case were:

1. Use the task and tier fixed in the selection manifest; do not replace a hard or failed case with a more favorable one.
2. Act as the human operator: reason about the task, invoke the environment's normal tools, and create the requested answer, patch, or artifact directly.
3. Do not inspect a gold answer, reference solution, or evaluator-specific expected artifact before freezing the answer or work product.
4. Invoke the upstream official evaluator once and preserve its first terminal result.
5. Explain evaluator failures from the retained evidence, but do not revise and resubmit a failed case.

GAIA's upstream Levels 1/2/3 supply its difficulty tiers. AndroidWorld and Terminal-Bench use upstream difficulty labels. SWE-bench Verified uses the upstream human-time buckets `<15 min`, `15 min - 1 hour`, and `>4 hours`. τ²-bench uses two, three, and nine composed telecom faults. OSWorld-Verified has no difficulty field, so the preregistered operational proxies are one persistent setting in one application, one structured transformation in one application, and a cross-application artifact transformation.

[`results.json`](results.json) is the machine-readable 18-case index. The files below are the canonical per-step records:

- [`runs/gaia/operator_answers.json`](runs/gaia/operator_answers.json)
- [`runs/androidworld/results.json`](runs/androidworld/results.json)
- [`runs/swe-bench-verified/results.json`](runs/swe-bench-verified/results.json)
- [`runs/tau2-bench/results.json`](runs/tau2-bench/results.json)
- [`runs/terminal-bench/results.json`](runs/terminal-bench/results.json)
- [`runs/osworld-verified/results.json`](runs/osworld-verified/results.json)

The τ² results directory also retains three exact benchmark transcripts, and the OSWorld directory retains the exact submitted `pyautogui` action logs. Large screenshots, benchmark images, containers, and source checkouts are intentionally excluded.

## Results at a glance

| Benchmark | Easy | Medium | Hard | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GAIA | Pass | Fail | Pass | 2/3 |
| AndroidWorld | Pass | Pass | Fail | 2/3 |
| SWE-bench Verified | Pass | Pass | Fail | 2/3 |
| τ²-bench | Pass | Pass | Fail | 2/3 |
| Terminal-Bench | Pass | Pass | Fail | 2/3 |
| OSWorld-Verified | Pass | Pass | Pass | 3/3 |
| **Overall** | **6/6** | **5/6** | **2/6** | **13/18** |

This tiny, deliberately stratified sample is a hands-on methodology exercise, not a benchmark leaderboard claim. In particular, the near-monotonic aggregate decline from easy to hard is descriptive only.

## Compatibility boundaries

- **AndroidWorld:** the reference gRPC accessibility feed/forwarder failed in this server environment. The runs retained upstream `HumanAgent`, task initialization, deterministic parameters, and official evaluators, but used AndroidWorld's upstream `UIAUTOMATOR` controller for observation.
- **τ²-bench:** no valid hosted-model credential was available for the benchmark's hidden user role. OpenAI credentials were absent and the available Anthropic credential returned HTTP 401. A locally cached `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` ran the standard hidden user scenario on CPU. Codex remained the support-agent operator. The simulator's role inversion is part of the hard-case failure, so results from this compatibility path must not be presented as reference-provider-comparable.
- **OSWorld-Verified:** the upstream Docker/KVM image was used with `/dev/kvm`. All computer interaction was performed through visible `pyautogui` actions. Full-resolution screenshots were retained during execution but omitted from Git; the exact submitted actions and first official scores are preserved.
- **SWE-bench Verified:** local setup failures were used only for diagnosis. The frozen patches were scored by the official containerized evaluation harness under run ID `exp7-2-human-20260803`.

## GAIA

Source commit: `682dd723ee1e1697e00360edccf2366dc8418dd9`.

### Easy — `2d83110e-a098-4ebb-9987-066c06fa42d0` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Interpret a sentence written backward and answer with the opposite of the word `left`.

**Trajectory.** I read the string from right to left, recovered the instruction “If you understand this sentence, write the opposite of the word left as the answer,” mapped `left` to its directional opposite, and froze the answer `right`.

**Evaluation.** The stored validation answer was `right`, so the exact-answer checker awarded `1.0`. The task succeeded because both decoding and antonym selection were exact.

### Medium — `7dd30055-0198-452e-8c25-f73dbe27dcb8` — Fail

**What the task was about.** Parse an attached PDB structure with Biopython, measure the distance between its first two listed atoms, and report the result rounded to the nearest picometer.

**Trajectory.** I fetched only the selected 2,897,289-byte LFS attachment. Creating an isolated Python environment initially failed because `ensurepip`/`python3.10-venv` was missing, so I installed that system package, created `/home/ubuntu/.venvs/exp7-2-gaia-v2`, and installed Biopython 1.85. `Bio.PDB.PDBParser(QUIET=True)` identified atom N followed by atom CA in chain A, residue 2. Biopython returned `1.4564234018325806` Å. Because 1 pm is 0.01 Å, I rounded to `1.46` Å and froze that answer.

**Evaluation.** The official stored answer was numeric `1.456`, and the reference checker compared it exactly rather than accepting the prompt-requested nearest-picometer rounding. It awarded `0.0`. This is recorded as a failure: `1.46` followed the stated rounding instruction, but it did not satisfy the actual checker. I did not replace it with the gold value after evaluation.

### Hard — `56db2318-640f-477a-a82f-bc93ad13e882` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Infer an unknown alternating checksum weight and an adjacent transposed column from ten ISBN-like records.

**Trajectory.** I removed hyphens and converted every 13-digit row to integers. I enumerated alternate weights 2 through 9 and allowed adjacent swaps whose smaller index was 3 through 10, excluding the fixed prefix and checksum digit. For every candidate I applied weights `1,w,1,w,...` across all 13 digits and required every row's weighted sum modulo 10 to be zero. Exactly one candidate survived: `(7, 9)`. I froze `7, 9`.

**Evaluation.** The answer exactly matched the stored validation answer, yielding `1.0`.

## AndroidWorld

Source commit: `0e95d641e244504c22087cc29b013f3b2428a261`. Suite seeds were 6201, 6202, and 6203.

### Easy — `ContactsAddContact` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Create a contact named Samuel Ali with phone number `+16237655787`.

**Trajectory.** I opened Contacts from the launcher, completed its first-run screen, chose **Create new contact**, entered `Samuel` and `Ali` in the name fields, entered the international number, saved, and observed the Samuel Ali detail page showing the formatted number `1 (623) 765-5787`.

**Evaluation.** The upstream state evaluator found the requested name and phone number in the contacts database and awarded `1.0`. Display punctuation did not alter the stored digits.

### Medium — `CameraTakeVideo` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Use the system Camera application to create one video.

**Trajectory.** I opened Camera, switched from still-photo mode to Video, pressed record, allowed about three seconds of capture, pressed stop, and left the created media artifact in device storage.

**Evaluation.** The official media-state evaluator found one newly created video and awarded `1.0`.

### Hard — `BrowserMultiply` — Fail

**What the task was about.** Open `task.html` from Downloads in Chrome, reveal a deterministic five-number sequence, remember it, and submit the product.

**Trajectory.** I opened Files, navigated to Downloads, selected `task.html`, chose Chrome, and completed Chrome's first-run prompts. I observed the initial `4`, then clicked the page button five times. The subsequent displayed values were `2`, `5`, `3`, and `7`; the fifth press revealed the answer form. I computed `4 × 2 × 5 × 3 × 7 = 840`, attempted to enter and submit `840`, and froze the browser state.

**Evaluation.** The official evaluator did not observe the page text `Success!`, so it awarded `0.0`. A post-evaluation replay of the pinned page's seeded RNG confirmed `[4, 2, 5, 3, 7]` and product `840`; therefore the reasoning was correct, but the final form interaction did not reach the required UI state. The retained evidence cannot distinguish an unfocused field, unregistered submit tap, or another transient UI mismatch. I did not rerun it.

## SWE-bench Verified

Source commit: `5cd4be9fb23971679cbbafe5a0ecade27cef99be`. Official run ID: `exp7-2-human-20260803`; 3 submitted, 2 resolved, 1 unresolved, 0 harness errors.

### Easy — `django__django-11133` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Make Django's `HttpResponse` preserve the bytes represented by a `memoryview` instead of serializing the object's representation.

**Trajectory.** I traced `HttpResponseBase.make_bytes` and the `HttpResponse.content` setter. `make_bytes` treated bytes atomically, but the setter classified `memoryview` as a generic iterable. I changed `make_bytes` to use `bytes(value)` for bytes or memoryview, excluded memoryview from the setter's iterable path, and added constructor and property-assignment regressions. After installing missing `sqlparse` and `pytz`, all 12 local `HttpResponseTests` passed. I froze and submitted the patch once.

**Evaluation.** The official fail-to-pass test passed, as did all 64 pass-to-pass tests. The case resolved because both byte conversion and iterable dispatch were corrected.

### Medium — `astropy__astropy-13033` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Make `TimeSeries` required-column errors show the complete expected and observed prefixes when multiple columns are mandatory.

**Trajectory.** I read the issue, hint, and checker in `astropy/timeseries/core.py`. I preserved the established scalar wording when only one column is required. For multiple columns, I formatted the entire required list and the observed prefix of equal maximum length, then added the reported time/flux removal regression with the exact message. The old local checkout could not build its compiled/version stack, so I treated that as setup evidence rather than a product test result. I froze and submitted the patch once.

**Evaluation.** The official reported-issue test and all 20 pass-to-pass groups passed, resolving the case.

### Hard — `sphinx-doc__sphinx-7590` — Fail

**What the task was about.** Teach Sphinx's C++ expression parser to handle numeric user-defined literal suffixes such as `q_J` and `q_s`.

**Trajectory.** I reproduced the path where the float token was consumed but its adjacent suffix remained and triggered “Expected end of definition.” I added a suffix regex without a leading word boundary, consumed the suffix into `ASTNumberLiteral`, and added decimal and integer UDL tests. After resolving setup-only Jinja and `roman` dependency failures, the complete local C++ expression-parser test passed, including the reported Planck constant declaration. I froze and submitted once.

**Evaluation.** The patch recognized and rendered numeric UDLs, and all 24 official pass-to-pass groups passed. The hidden fail-to-pass test additionally required an Itanium ABI expression ID representing a call to the literal operator. My patch generated `IE1CIAL5_udlE_1aE`; the expected ID was `IE1CIAclL_Zli4_udlEL5EE_1aE`. The unresolved ABI identity defect made the official result `0.0`; I did not revise or resubmit it.

## τ²-bench

Source commit: `8d005b0e5b9e4af0bc055886fa7f95fc86d1710e`. The support-agent trajectory was authored manually by Codex. The locally cached Qwen model supplied the benchmark's hidden user role under the compatibility boundary above.

### Easy — two faults — Pass

Task ID: `[mobile_data_issue]data_mode_off|data_usage_exceeded[PERSONA:None]`.

**What the task was about.** Restore mobile data after it had been turned off and its allowance exhausted, including correct paid-refuel consent.

**Trajectory.** I identified customer C1001 and affected line L1002, requested network diagnostics, directed the user to enable mobile data, and asked for a speed test. When it still failed, I inspected usage and plan P1002, finding 15.1 GB used against 15.0 GB and a $2/GB refuel. I offered up to 2 GB, explicitly confirmed the $4 total, called `refuel_data` only after consent, and requested a final test. The result was 275 Mbps (Excellent), after which I summarized the $4 charge and ended the interaction.

**Evaluation.** Official reward `1.0`: mobile data was enabled, 2 GB was added with confirmation, and the final connection was Excellent.

### Medium — three faults — Pass

Task ID: `[mobile_data_issue]bad_vpn|data_saver_mode_on|user_abroad_roaming_disabled_on[PERSONA:None]`.

**What the task was about.** Repair poor data abroad caused by carrier-side roaming being off, Data Saver being on, and a degraded VPN.

**Trajectory.** I looked up the customer, mistakenly called nonexistent `get_line_by_id`, preserved the tool error, and recovered with `get_details_by_id`. I identified L1002, established that the user was abroad, and enabled carrier-side roaming. I followed the slow-data workflow: requested restriction status, directed Data Saver off, checked VPN performance before changing it, then directed the degraded OpenVPN connection to disconnect. The final speed test reported 275 Mbps (Excellent).

**Evaluation.** Official reward `1.0`. The three required action checks—`enable_roaming`, `toggle_data_saver_mode`, and `disconnect_vpn`—all passed, as did the final environment assertion. The early invalid tool call changed no state and was correctly recovered.

### Hard — nine faults — Fail

Task ID: `[mms_issue]airplane_mode_on|bad_network_preference|bad_wifi_calling|break_apn_mms_setting|break_app_sms_permission|data_mode_off|data_usage_exceeded|unseat_sim_card|user_abroad_roaming_disabled_on[PERSONA:None]`.

**What the task was about.** Repair an MMS failure containing nine independent faults across radio state, SIM, roaming, data, allowance, network mode, Wi-Fi Calling, application permissions, and APN settings.

**Trajectory.** I established the affected line and baseline MMS failure; diagnosed and disabled airplane mode; diagnosed and reseated the SIM; enabled carrier-side roaming; enabled mobile data; diagnosed the exhausted allowance; confirmed and applied a 2 GB refuel for $4; changed the preferred network from 2G to `4g_5g_preferred`; disabled Wi-Fi Calling; granted the Messaging app's missing SMS permission; identified the missing MMSC URL; reset APN settings and rebooted. The terminal checks showed that MMS could be sent and the data speed was 275 Mbps (Excellent).

The trajectory also records repeated recovery from user-simulator role inversion. Qwen frequently told the support agent to execute phone-side tools instead of executing them as the user. Near the step limit I explicitly requested multiple ordered phone calls in a single response. The exact operator turns are retained in `runs/tau2-bench/hard-transcript.json`.

**Evaluation.** Official reward `0.0`. Although the final environment state was repaired, the episode hit the benchmark's 100-step cap before a recognized terminal stop. The official evaluator classified it as prematurely terminated and did not score the repaired state. This is an episode-level failure caused by the local user-model compatibility path, not a claim of benchmark success; I did not rerun it.

## Terminal-Bench

Source commit: `8384a179b1b8688f6ea5233a4d9d51218df1ac96`.

### Easy — `fix-permissions` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Diagnose why `/app/process_data.sh` could not execute and repair it.

**Trajectory.** I listed `/app`, read the public script, and observed mode `664` (`-rw-rw-r--`). Running it produced `Permission denied` and exit 126. I ran `chmod +x`, confirmed mode `775`, ran the script successfully, observed `Data processed successfully!`, and invoked the upstream test script.

**Evaluation.** The single official test `test_script_permissions` passed. Missing execute bits were the complete defect.

### Medium — `simple-sheets-put` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Populate a stateful spreadsheet REST service while creating exactly one spreadsheet.

**Trajectory.** I queried `/spreadsheets/` and confirmed zero initial objects, then used `/docs/json` to map spreadsheet, sheet, individual-cell, and batch-cell endpoints. I created one `Financial Report` spreadsheet and one `Q1 Data` sheet. The advertised batch-cell PUT returned HTTP 400 without mutation, so I used the documented individual-cell PUT for A1:D4. I entered the four headers, January–March rows, and profits 2000, 3000, and 5000. A final GET confirmed one spreadsheet and all 16 cells before evaluation.

**Evaluation.** All three official tests—spreadsheet, sheet, and cell creation—passed. The fallback preserved the singleton constraint and completed every value.

### Hard — `dna-assembly` — Fail

**What the task was about.** Design the minimum Golden Gate primer set that assembles a backbone, EGFP, FLAG linker, and SNAP into an exact circular target plasmid while satisfying primer constraints.

**Trajectory.** I parsed five FASTA records, confirmed no internal BsaI sites, aligned the target, and inferred the intended component boundaries. I selected four primer pairs with junction overhangs `ATGA`, `GGTA`, `GACA`, and `TAAT`. Simulating the four digested fragments produced the exact 3,591-nt circular target up to rotation. I installed primer3, chose annealing tracts with the required thermodynamic parameters, wrote eight nonblank FASTA records, and invoked the official evaluator once.

**Evaluation.** `test_primers` failed. The FLAG forward overhang's four-base suffix also matched the adjacent template, so the evaluator correctly included it in the annealing tract. That primer's evaluated Tm was `66.056662°C`, versus `60.610114°C` for FLAG reverse—a `5.446548°C` gap, exceeding the at-most-5°C constraint. My pre-evaluation check measured only the explicit 15-base binding suffix. The assembly itself was exact, but the primer-pair thermodynamic constraint made the official result a failure; no post-evaluation revision was made.

## OSWorld-Verified

Source commit: `8365edc975efd0477a0d62444a5beed562ab5a7b`. Each artifact was frozen before its official evaluator ran.

### Easy — `2cd43775-7085-45d8-89fa-9e35c0a915cf` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Enable LibreOffice AutoRecovery every three minutes.

**Trajectory.** I opened LibreOffice Options with Alt+F12, expanded Load/Save, opened General, enabled **Save AutoRecovery information every**, changed the interval from 10 to 3, committed the dialog, reopened it to visually verify persistence, and closed it without further mutation.

**Evaluation.** Official result `1`. The evaluator found AutoRecovery enabled with a three-minute interval.

### Medium — `7e429b8d-a3f0-4ed0-9b58-08957d00b127` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Fill officer names in a Calc table by matching each row's branch to a lookup table.

**Trajectory.** I entered `=VLOOKUP(E2;$A$2:$B$7;2;0)` in F2, selected F2:F12, filled down with Ctrl+D, visually checked the resulting names, and saved the workbook in place.

**Evaluation.** Official result `1.0`. The artifact evaluator found every officer name correctly matched to its headoffice.

### Hard — `51f5801c-18b3-4f25-b0c3-02f85507a078` — Pass

**What the task was about.** Extract every presenter note from `Dickinson_Slides.pptx`, write only the note text into an unformatted Word document, and save it as `Desktop/notes.docx`.

**Trajectory.** I switched Impress to Notes view and visited slides 1 through 9 in order. I transcribed: `This is opening slide.`, `Cover slide option #1`, `Cover slide option #3`, `This is a graph.`, `This is a table.`, `This is item lists.`, `This is an inserted image.`, and `Blank ending slide`. Slide 7 contained only the empty “Click to add Notes” placeholder, so I omitted it. I opened Writer from the visible launcher, entered the eight texts as plain paragraphs with no labels or page numbers, opened Save As, selected Desktop, chose Word 2007–365 format, named the file `notes.docx`, and visually verified the filename and content before freezing.

**Evaluation.** Official result `1`. The evaluator accepted the document, ordering, omission of the empty placeholder, location, filename, and lack of added formatting.

## Interpretation

The five failures expose five different boundaries:

1. **Answer normalization:** GAIA medium's requested rounding disagreed with the strict stored numeric value.
2. **Last-mile UI state:** AndroidWorld hard had correct arithmetic but did not reach the page's visible success state.
3. **Hidden semantic contract:** SWE-bench hard handled syntax but missed the ABI call identity required by the official test.
4. **Constraint verification:** Terminal-Bench hard assembled the exact product but misidentified the full annealing tract for one primer.
5. **Episode protocol:** τ²-bench hard repaired the environment but exhausted the turn budget under a role-inverting local user simulator.

That diversity is the main value of the exercise: “the answer looked right” is weaker than an official terminal result, and failures often occur at normalization, interaction, representation, secondary constraints, or protocol termination rather than at the apparent core task.
